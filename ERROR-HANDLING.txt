Battleship handles the following types of errors and exceptions,
when it encounters them:
    - Errors setting the look & feel of the application
    - In the AI:
        - Doesn't make moves when these moves would be off the board
        - Recovers gracefully when it loses the trail of a ship
        - Errors placing a ship at a location
        - No remaining squares to search for ships at
    - Invalid co-ordinates when firing
    - Firing prior to all ships being placed
    - A ship being placed such that it exits the board or overlaps
      with another ship
    - Invalid player when creating a BattleshipBoardDisplay
    - Mouse click not on the Battleship board
    - Rotation loops around
    - Window resizing after game is in progress
    - min > max when getting a random number in a range

It also displays unrecoverable errors in a somewhat nicer way than Java does
by default (see BattleshipGameProgram->masterErrorHandler)
